# Hi! I'm Matias Baldanza
(_/mah-tee-ass/_ but people also call me _Matt_ or _Mati_.)

I'm a developer, support specialist, and technical content creator from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.

I used to work as a translator, and I'm fully bilingual (English and Spanish.)

If you arrived here, you were probably provided with link to a custom resume. <br>
